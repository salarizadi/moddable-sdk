# [Moddable SDK](https://github.com/Moddable-OpenSource/moddable)

I'm interested in Moddable SDK, it's really great and amazing, that's why I created a Repository to fix some of the shortcomings of this SDK. From now on you can use the modules I make for free.

Latest modules :
  - SDcard for (esp32) [GET START](https://github.com/salarizadi/moddable-sdk/blob/main/Modules/SD/GET_START.md)
  - ? (Coming soon)
